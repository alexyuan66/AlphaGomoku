12/7    8:00pm      3:00    Further implemented Gomoku using code based on Kalah in HW4. 
                            Debugged code and tested on edge cases
12/8    3:00pm      3:00    Created powerpoint presentation for video
12/10   7:00pm      4:00    Recorded, edited, and submitted video
12/16   7:00pm      5:00    Implemented MCTS with UCT0, AMAF and leaf parallelization 
                            enhancements. Tested implementation and realized there was a 
                            bug in the Gomoku code. Debugged further and discussed and designed 
                            the implementation for a greedy agent heuristic. Tested greedy agent 
                            on random and and MCTS agents.
12/17   10:00am     2:00    Began planning out implementation for a UCT2 MCTS algorithm with an 
                            implicit tree.
12/17   2:00pm      4:00    Implemented UCT2 MCTS algorithm with an implicit tree and experimented
                            with and debugged code. Implemented AMAF and leaf parallelization enhancements.
                            Discussed genetic algorithm implementation with partner. Whiteboarded skeleton
                            code for genetic algorithm.
12/17   8:00pm      4:00    Finalized UCT2 MCTS algorithm with enhancements and realized there was another 
                            bug in the Gomoku code. Fixed the bug and experimented. Wrote the report and 
                            created scripts for overnight testing.
12/18   11:00am     2:00    Final tuning, testing, and report writing. Ran through spec to ensure everything
                            was completed.
12/18   3:00pm      2:00    Additional checking, logging, and documenting code.
12/19   1:00am      3:00    Realized there was an additional bug in genetic.py, fixed bug, will be using late days for this project
12/19   9:00am      3:00    Continued debugging, finalized and resubmitted
